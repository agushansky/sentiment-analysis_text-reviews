### Using customer review data about theme parks to make informed strategic decisions

#### Problem Statement & Motivation

Theme parks are at the center of spur-of-the-moment excursions and vacations in the U.S. and around the world. Millions flock each year to try the newest bone-ratting roller-coaster, or reach new heights at near-supersonic speeds. Theme parks are a hallmark of adventure-seekers and adrenaline-junkies, and they collectively bring in billions of dollars yearly.
